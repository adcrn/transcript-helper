A utility that uses IBM's Bluemix Speech-to-Text service to assist in adding transcripts to videos in order to maintain ADA compliance at a particular institution of higher learning. Basically, it makes my job easier. Heavily influenced by Dan Nguyen's [watson-word-watcher](https://github.com/dannguyen/watson-word-watcher).
